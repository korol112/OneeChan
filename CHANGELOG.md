### v5.2.4
*2014-05-02*

**Nebukazar**

This will pin the TW as a sidebar depending on which side the SS Sidebar is placed, or default to left when the latter is disabled. This option uses a lot of roundabout ways to achieve and renders really slowly due to using multiple CSS3 selectors, you've been warned.
